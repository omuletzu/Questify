## Questify
**Questify** is a **Q&A platform** designed for users to ask questions, share knowledge, and engage in meaningful discussions. Built with **Spring Boot**, **React**, and **PostgreSQL**, it leverages a **microservice architecture** to ensure a seamless and efficient experience for **knowledge exchange**.

## Features
**Authentication and security**
- Users can create an account by providing **username**, **password**, **email**, and **phone number**.
- Upon **registration** or **login**, they receive a secure **token**, which is used throughout their browsing session to validate interactions with the appâ€™s **microservice**.

**Viewing and interacting with questions**
- Users can browse **recent questions**, added by other users.
- Each question includes, **title**, **text**, multiple **tags**, and **images** (stored as **URLs**).
- Users can **upvote** or **downvote** the question, affecting both:
  - The question's **score**
  - The author's **score**

**Posting and managing content**
- Users can **post questions** with **title**, **description**, **tags**, and **images**.
- Questions have three possible **statuses**:
  - **Sent** (newly posted)
  - **In progress** (currently receiving comments)
  - **Solved** (marked by the author, no one can add or edit anything)
- Once a question is marked as **solved**, it becomes **locked** and it can be only deleted from that point on.

**Search and filtering**
- Users can filter the question by:
  - **Title** (this also includes subtitles)
  - **Username** (the author of the post)
  - **Tags**
  - Their own **questions**

**Admin features**
- These are special users with privileges:
  - **Ban / Unban users**
  - Banned users can no longer use the app and they will receive an **SMS notification** that they've been banned.
